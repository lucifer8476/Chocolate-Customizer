# Chocolate-Customizer
Web Development Approach:
HTML Structure:

You've used HTML5, providing a clean and semantic structure for your web page.
CSS Styling:

Bootstrap (v4.5.2): Utilized Bootstrap for styling and layout components. Bootstrap offers a responsive grid system, pre-designed components, and styling, making it easier to create a visually appealing and responsive interface.
Styling Customization:

You've added some custom styles in a separate CSS file (styles.css) for specific styling adjustments, such as defining the maximum size for chocolate images.
JavaScript:

Vanilla JavaScript: Your JavaScript code is written in vanilla JavaScript without relying on any additional libraries or frameworks for this specific functionality.
Tools and Frameworks Used:
Bootstrap (v4.5.2):

Utilized Bootstrap classes for grid layout (col-lg-6, col-md-4) and styling components (e.g., cards, list groups).
jQuery (v3.5.1):

Used jQuery, a fast and lightweight JavaScript library, for simplifying DOM manipulation and handling events.
Popper.js (v2.9.1):

Included Popper.js as a dependency for Bootstrap's dropdowns and popovers.
Animate.css (v4.1.1):

Integrated Animate.css for adding animations to enhance the user experience. Used animations like animate__fadeIn to bring a dynamic feel to the page.
Reasoning:
Bootstrap for Rapid Development:

Bootstrap accelerates development with its ready-to-use components and responsive grid system. It ensures a consistent and visually appealing design across different devices.
jQuery for DOM Manipulation:

jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling, making it easier to write concise and cross-browser-compatible JavaScript code.
Animate.css for Animations:

Adding animations with Animate.css enhances the user interface, providing a smoother transition between different states on the page. It adds a professional touch to the user experience.
Separation of Concerns:

You've separated your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into distinct files. This follows the principle of separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.
Responsive Design:

Bootstrap's responsive design components ensure that the web page adapts well to various screen sizes, improving the overall accessibility and user experience.
